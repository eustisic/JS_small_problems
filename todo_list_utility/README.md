todoApp.js is a utility tool written in JavaScript with ES6 syntax for managing a simple task list.

Included in this package is a testing application that executes a series of tests using the todoApp.js script. 

This project is an excellent demonstration of object oriented JavaScript.  It uses multiple object creation patterns. It demonstrats how the prototype object of an object may be leveraged to provide shared methods. And, it shows how private methods may be provided through the closure.
